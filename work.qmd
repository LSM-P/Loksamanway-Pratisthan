# Walking With Communities, Building With Rights

Loksamanway Pratishthan’s work is rooted in the belief that Adivasi communities must be at the center of their own development. We do not just implement projects — we co-create plans with Gram Sabhas, support local leadership, and strengthen constitutional and forest-based rights through sustained village-level engagement.

## 📽 Documenting Child Malnutrition 

In 2007, Loksamanway Pratishthan trained Adivasi adolescent girls from Nandurbar district to monitor malnutrition. Over three months of training and six months of fieldwork, they tracked children's weight and uncovered discrepancies in official records — showing how Anganwadi workers underreported malnutrition levels. Their findings were documented in this short film:

## 🌳 Securing Forest Rights and Gram Sabha Governance

Since 2006, Loksamanway Pratishthan has supported communities in securing **Individual Forest Rights (IFR)** and **Community Forest Rights (CFR)**. After PESA rules formulation by the Maharashtra Government in 2014, we also helped implement the **PESA Act**, ensuring that village development is planned through Gram Sabha institutions.

We have facilitated the formation and training of CFR committees in 32 villages across Nandurbar and Jalgaon, helping prepare 10-year CFR micro-plans, build convergence with government schemes, and promote participatory forest governance.

## 👩🏾‍🌾 Tribal Women in Agriculture and Governance

Tribal women are at the heart of our farming and planning work. We have built *Krishi Mandals* (women’s farmer groups) in over 30 villages, offering training on sustainable agriculture, farm inputs, and market readiness.

## 🌱 Sustainable Livelihoods and Ecological Agriculture

Our agroecology work promotes value-added, biodiversity-based farming practices that restore soil health, reduce migration, and build climate resilience.

We support:

- Mixed cropping and intercropping  
- Organic fertilization and soil conservation  
- Local tool banks and seed banks  
- Collective processing of non-timber forest produce like gum and turmeric

In 2017, we partnered with **Jain Agro Foods** to conduct extensive **tree plantation** drives in tribal hamlets as part of our reforestation and livelihood program.
