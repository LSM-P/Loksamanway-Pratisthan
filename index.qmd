We are a grassroots organization working since 1994 across the tribal regions of North Maharashtra, especially in Nandurbar and Jalgaon districts. Our mission is to empower Adivasi communities by strengthening their rights over natural resources — *jal, jungle, zameen* — and promoting participatory development grounded in **PESA** (Panchayats Extension to Scheduled Areas Act), **IFR** (Individual Forest Rights), and **CFR** (Community Forest Rights).

We support Gram Sabhas in asserting their forest rights, develop 10-year micro-plans for CFR areas, and promote sustainable agriculture through training, input support, and cluster-building among tribal women farmers. These efforts enhance food security, improve incomes, and reduce seasonal migration.

We collaborate closely with government departments and civil society organizations to ensure the effective implementation of rights-based development programs. Our partnerships span public health, biodiversity conservation, tribal education, and natural resource management.

## We specialize in

- Forest rights and community-led biodiversity planning  
- Tribal health and malnutrition reduction  
- Women and youth empowerment  
- Training in tribal dialects and languages  
- Sustainable agriculture and cluster-based development
