    "text": "From the Hills of Satpuda: Our Story\nLoksamanway Pratishthan was founded in 1994 by a group of young activists ‚Äî including Pratibha Shinde and Sanjay Mahajan ‚Äî who emerged from the student movements of the early 1990s. Inspired by both protest and possibility, they sought to build an organization rooted in struggle (sangharsh) and constructive work (rachanatmak kaam) for Adivasi communities.\nThe organization took shape in Taloda, on the edge of the Satpuda mountain range, home to Bhil and Pawra tribes whose history stretches back thousands of years. Despite this deep connection to the land, tribal communities faced growing threats: deforestation, displacement, lack of infrastructure, and the erosion of local livelihoods.\nLoksamanway Pratishthan began as a response ‚Äî not just to poverty, but to disempowerment."

Across Nandurbar and Jalgaon, its staff continues to live, speak, and work among the people ‚Äî in over 80 villages today.\nWhether supporting CFR micro-plans, leading adolescent girls‚Äô forums, or training health workers in tribal dialects, the organization has remained committed to its founding values: dignity, rights, and self-rule.\n\nüå± ‚ÄúIn the valleys of Satpuda, we learned that true development walks with the people.‚Äù"
