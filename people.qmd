## Grassroots Staff and Volunteers

Our work is powered by dozens of local staff and volunteers based in tribal villages across Nandurbar and Jalgaon. Their on-the-ground knowledge, relationships, and commitment make every initiative possible â€” from forest rights to food security, from womenâ€™s farming to child health.
